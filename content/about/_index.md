I am Kshitijaa Jaglan - a PhD student at [Social Computing Group, University of Zürich](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/scg). My interests lie in **Networks (graphs), AI+ML (and ethics), data engineering, MLOps, open source**, oh and yes definitely \[TW?\] [cats](https://cataas.com/cat/gif) too. 

Given enough food and time, I also enjoy making seemingly random tools out of boredom/utility. Check out [this](https://deutranium.github.io/Japanese-Practice/) if you want to learn [Hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana), or [this](https://github.com/deutranium/WhatsApp-desktop-app) if you want a WhatsApp desktop app for Linux. 

**Fun fact:** I also discovered a bug leaking data of 100,000+ students (reported and mitigated). The data included personal information like address, phone number, email, parent's name etc. As you might've gotten a hint already, one of my other domains of interest is privacy (and fairness!).
