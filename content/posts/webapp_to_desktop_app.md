### Storytime
During COVID, I was using WhatsApp a lil' more than normal - more so on laptop. Despite it being a convinient app, I was tired of always having to open a browser window, typing `web.`, navigating to and selecting the suggested WhatsApp Web link, waiting for the page to load and finally being able to access the chats. What would be a convinient alternative? A simple keyboard shortcut that opens WhatsApp as a standalone window. Why do we want a standalone window? Because it is easier to navigate a few application windows than tens of browser tabs.
